     <h2>Introdution</h2><br>
     <p>Air quality index (AQI) is a measure of how polluted the air is or how polluted it is expected to be. It is calculated based on the levels of different air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). Different countries have different methods and standards for calculating AQI, but the general principle is that the higher the AQI value, the worse the air quality and the more harmful it is for human health.<br>
      <br>
       The AQI is usually divided into different categories, each with a corresponding color code and health advisory. For example, the U.S. AQI has six categories: Good (0-50, green), Moderate (51-100, yellow), Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150, orange), Unhealthy (151-200, red), Very Unhealthy (201-300, purple), and Hazardous (301-500, maroon)3. Each category indicates the potential health effects of exposure to the air pollution, such as respiratory symptoms, aggravation of existing conditions, or increased risk of serious illness.<br>
       <br>
       The AQI is useful for informing the public about the current or forecasted air quality in their area, and for providing guidance on how to protect themselves from the adverse effects of air pollution. For example, people can check the AQI on websites, apps, or monitors, and follow the recommendations for reducing their exposure, such as avoiding outdoor activities, wearing masks, or using air purifiers143. The AQI can also help policymakers and regulators to implement measures to improve air quality, such as setting emission standards, enforcing pollution control, or promoting clean energy sources.<br>

      <br><br> Canaries in coal mines provided advanced warning of toxic gases. <br>
      These living, mobile, handheld sensors saved countless lives of miners<br>
       by detecting high concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and <br>
       methane. These small birds played an important part of mining safety and <br>
       retired from mining the mid-1980s.</p><br>

      <p>Drager develops first portable tube for detecting carbon <br>
        monoxide for the mining industry. Today, Drager tubes detect<br>
         100s of different gases. The tubes are glass vials filled with <br>
         a chemical reagent that reacts to a specific chemical or family <br>
         of chemicals.  A sample of air drawn into the tube changes the <br>
         tube's color when the targeted chemical(s) are detected. The <br>
        length of the color change typically indicates the measured concentration.<br></p><br>

        (VOCs).  First introduced in 1974, early portable PIDs were<br>
         bulky, heavy (9 lbs.), and had a separate hand-held probe and<br>
          a controller carried by a shoulder strap. Today, with advances ,<br>
          in electronics, batteries, and detectors, these devices are<br>
           now small, portable and used widely in industrial hygiene <br>
